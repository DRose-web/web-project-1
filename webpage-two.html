    <!-- in this sction i discuss a little about me and why i enjoy cardio and outdoors using different text styles or fonts to show 
    points, tone, and meaning in what i am communicating-->
    <section><header><h1 style="color:rgb(246, 246, 246);"> More of me! </h1></header>
    <main><p style="color:blue;">As you may have already noticed I am passionate about mother nature and its beautiful occurrences. I enjoy being outside and in fresh air 
    even if its <i>scorching hot</i> or <b> freezing cold</b> outside. My favourite outside temperature outside is when it is relitevily 
    warm in the fall but there is a <sup> Cool Brease </sup> whooshing through the air and cooling me down during my walk, jog, or hike!</p>
    <br/>
    <!-- in this section i explain my troubles with my hair constantly changing with the weather and i made a small form to ask if 
    anybody else has had this experience I made sure that they must input atleast 20 words for detail and not over 1000 words because i dont want to read that -->
    <p style="color:rgb(15, 15, 134);"> In my opininon I think that my hair reacts alot to the weather outside. This is usually only when I spend a longer amount of time 
    outside in on a certain day. So, when I go outside in the summer and relax on a lawn chair reading a book or going on a walk, my hair 
    always manages to become greasy. I know it's gross, but I genuinely want to know who else gets this? I could wear a hat and only go outside
    for a very hsour period of time, my body would not even sweat in the amount of time I am outside. I take the hat off and there it is again
    my hair is greasy again even though i washed it the same day. 
    In the winter my hair tends to get really dry. If I even do as much as walk to get the mail my hair gets very dry like the desert. But, it 
    also gets frozen into place even if it is all dry. If I tuck all of my hair into a nice warm touque it still becomes dry. It can be 
    layered with every single warming item i own and it will still be dry even if i washed it 5 days ago.
    Does everybody get this or is my hair just weird?</p></main></section>

    <!--in this part i made a form for people to introduce themselves a bit and apply to join out memebers and out community. I used the feildset
    because i wanted the form to look seperate from the rest of the page and so it would be easier for me to see what is supposed to be 
    inside the form or not as it compiles the form into that set feild. the labels is what shows what i want the name of the input in the 
    form to show . the input type describes what kind of inpput it will be so a selection dropdown for example and the next would be a text 
    input. the id helps identify where it belongs and with what label. the sumbit button allows them to sum=bmit the information.-->
