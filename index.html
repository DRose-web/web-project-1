    <!--from here until the pictures i am explaining why people should hike and explore the outdoors. I wrote two paragraphs and two headings.-->
    <header><h2 style="color:rgb(12, 40, 12);"><b><i>why choose hiking?</i></b></h2></header>
    <br/>
    <section><main><article><p style="color:green;" style="background-color:rgb(168, 164, 243);"> <i> Hiking is an excellent choice of physical
    activity because it combines cardiovascular exercise with the benefits of being in nature. Unlike high-intensity workouts, hiking is a low-impact
    activity that improves endurance, strengthens muscles, and enhances balance without putting excessive strain on joints. It also provides mental
    health benefits by reducing stress, boosting mood, and increasing mindfulness through exposure to fresh air and scenic landscapes. Additionally,
    hiking can be easily adapted to different fitness levels, making it an inclusive activity for people of all ages. Whether on a short nature walk
    or a challenging mountain trail, hiking promotes overall well-being while allowing individuals to connect with nature and enjoy the outdoors. <i> </p></article>

        <br/>
    <article><p style="color:green;" style="background-color:rgb(168, 164, 243)"> <i> Outdoor exploration and sightseeing are great 
    choices for both physical and mental well-being, offering a perfect blend of adventure, relaxation, and discovery. Exploring new places, whether 
    natural landscapes or cultural landmarks, encourages movement, helping to improve physical health through walking, climbing, or other light
    activities. It also stimulates the mind by exposing individuals to new environments, histories, and perspectives, fostering curiosity and learning.
    Additionally, spending time outdoors reduces stress, boosts mood, and enhances creativity by providing a refreshing break from daily routines.
    Whether visiting a scenic national park, wandering through a historic city, or admiring breathtaking views, outdoor exploration and sightseeing
    create memorable experiences while promoting overall wellness. Plus who doesn't like to capture that picture perfect moment every once in a while. </i> </p></article></main></section>
